          <h1>Facts about Shitz Tzu</h1>
          <p>
            "Shih tzu are renowned for their perky, happy temperaments. They are lively and friendly. Shih tzu tend to get along well with people of all ages and with other dogs as well as other pets of different species. Rarely you will find a snippy shih tzu, but most are very sweet." -HillSpet

            "Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room." -DogTime

          <p>I personally would like to own one because i've never had a dog but smaller dogs seem nicer to take care of.</p>
